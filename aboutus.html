        I am Jaden Baker, and I am the independent owner of The Spot. I started this resturaunt in 2026 after raising enough money to buy a place and start the business after becoming uninterested in my previous career, Software Development. 
        Burnt out and with low motivation to continue, I set forth creating this place.

      <p style=" padding-left: 6.5vw; text-indent: 40px;">
        I really enjoyed American diner food, but I realize that the style is long out of fashion, ran by only long lasting individuals or a few chains
        like steak and shake. I wanted to bring that to a more modern setting, while still retaining the cheap diner food most people love. The Spot serves burgers, fries, and hotdogs,
        along with variations of them, such as vegetarian options or different toppings. We serve the standard drinks, coffee, soda, along with different alcoholic drinks at the bar.

      <p style=" padding-left: 6.5vw; text-indent: 40px;">
        Our mission and our goal is to provide a both a premium experience and good food. We also strive to have the best service possible, good prices, and good food. 
        If there are issues with the business, the food, or the employees, we encourage open communication from our customers to us, so please, if there is anything wrong,
         do not be afraid to send us an email through our contact form or talk to management in person. 
         We will do our best to resolve your issue so that we can always improve and make this the best place possible. 
         As this is my first restaurant, every problem is just another learning experience from which I can use to let the spot reach its full potential.
