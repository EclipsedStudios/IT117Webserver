        The Spot is the one of the newest resturaunts in the Downtown Fargo Area! We serve classic American diner food, like burgers and fries, along with serving alcoholic beverages at the bar.
        By using a limited menu, we can pass the savings onto you while not skimping on the quality. So come on down to downtown Fargo and try some good food and enjoy time with good people!
